# Diagram type map (shared)

30 legal categories mapped to Mermaid types. Source taxonomy: legal-diagram discovery doc. Used by `direct.md` Step 2 and `extract.md` Step 5.

**How to read.** When user names a legal category → map to its **primary** type. If row marked **ambiguous** → do not map directly; call `diagram_selector.py` with enriched extraction so entity counts break the tie. **Driving field** = the `ExtractionResult` field dominating selection.

**Renderer note.** `Sankey`, `architecture`, `kanban`, `classDiagram` render unevenly. Selector never returns them; substitutes listed primary (e.g. flowchart for Sankey funds flow, erDiagram for classDiagram entity models). Quirk column → row in `shared/parser-guards.md`.

## Mindmap scope rule

Mindmap = **brainstorming and orientation only.** Tree structure: every node has exactly one parent; edges carry no labels; cross-links impossible. Use only when hierarchy is the entire point and relationship precision is not required.

**Mindmap is banned when matter involves any of the following:**

- Arguments, claims, or defenses (directed support/contradiction between nodes)
- Evidence chains (one fact supporting multiple claims, or undermining a defense)
- Obligations, compliance, or regulatory requirements
- Directed causality (X leads to Y leads to Z)
- Parties, entities, or relationships requiring labeled edges or cardinality
- Any intent phrased as "map the arguments", "show how X supports Y", "trace the reasoning"

For all above, use **flowchart** (directed graph with labeled edges). Flowchart expresses everything a mindmap can, plus directed logic, multiple parents, and edge labels. Selector must prefer flowchart over mindmap whenever any precision field is populated in extraction.

**Precision guard (called from `workflows/generation.md` Step 1).** When fixed type is `mindmap`, check enriched extraction for any non-empty precision field: `obligations`, `parties`, `ownership_links`, `relationships`, `risk_level`, `decision_points`, `process_steps`, `communications`, `transfers`, `risk_items`, `legal_authorities`. If any populated, flag mismatch once before proceeding:

> "Mind maps are trees: no labeled edges, no directed logic, no cross-links. Your matter has [populated field(s)], which need directed relationships. A **flowchart** would preserve that precision. Proceed with the mind map, switch to a flowchart, or pick an alternative?"

Wait for user's answer. This counts as the one allowed interruption. After user confirms, honour their choice with no further challenge.

## Plain-language names (user-facing)

In all text user reads, name diagrams with these plain words, never the Mermaid type. Technical name stays internal (scripts, workflows). Accept plain-word requests from user and map back to the type the same way.

|Mermaid type|Say to the user|
|---|---|
|`timeline`|timeline|
|`gantt`|schedule (timeline with durations)|
|`flowchart`|flowchart, or "decision tree" when it walks a yes/no test|
|`state diagram`|status flow (how something moves through stages)|
|`erDiagram`|org chart, or relationship map|
|`requirementDiagram`|obligation checklist (compliance map)|
|`sequenceDiagram`|who-does-what-when (back-and-forth diagram)|
|`mindmap`|mind map|
|`quadrantChart`|priority grid (a 2x2)|
|`journey`|experience map|

Example delivery: "I drew a **timeline**. This matter would also work as an **org chart** or an **obligation checklist** — want either?" Not: "recommended_type: timeline, alternatives: erDiagram, requirementDiagram."
