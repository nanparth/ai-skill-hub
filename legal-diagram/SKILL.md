# /legal-diagram

Standalone skill: turn legal material into a context-appropriate Mermaid diagram, with an optional downloadable HTML figure. A structure-preserving Python engine extracts a typed ground truth; directive-driven LLM enrichment fills the gaps; a selector picks the diagram type; the diagram is generated natively.

## Routing gate

Every real diagram request runs in this fixed order: first-run check, ingest, build-mode gate, generate, report gate. Non-diagram intents short-circuit at Step 0. Three human gates present as a structured choice when the host assistant supports one, otherwise a numbered list in plain text; never free-text prompts. Stop and wait for the reply at each. The gates are GATE 0 (tutorial offer), GATE A (build mode), GATE B (HTML report).

### Step 0 — Intent and first-run

Check explicit short-circuits first:

1. **Tutorial** signals: "tutorial", "show me how", "first time", "demo", "walk me through", `--tutorial`. → Load `workflows/tutorial.md`. Stop here.
2. **Setup** signals: "check setup", "install deps", "is setup ready". → Load `shared/setup-check.md`, run `check_setup.py`, report. Stop here.

Otherwise this is a real diagram request (a file, pasted text, or a matter description). Detect first-run:

Run `python scripts/first_run.py`. Parse `{state}`: `returning`, `first_run`, or `unknown`. Script absent, non-zero exit, or no JSON → treat as `unknown`.

- `first_run` → **GATE 0** (structured choice): "First time here. Want a quick tutorial, or go straight to your diagram?" Options: **Start tutorial** (recommended, list first) / **Skip, straight to my diagram**. After the user answers, run `python scripts/first_run.py --mark` to consume the flag. Then: tutorial → load `workflows/tutorial.md`, stop; skip → continue to Step 1.
- `returning` → no offer. Continue to Step 1.
- `unknown` → no prompt (ephemeral or no persistent disk; do not nag every session). Continue to Step 1. Tutorial stays reachable by keyword.

### Step 1 — Ingest before choosing a lane

Detect input: file path, pasted text, or conversation/matter description. Load `shared/setup-check.md` (session-cached).

**Multi-file scope** (2+ files, user did not state scope): structured choice before ingesting, **One combined diagram** / **One per document**. Store `diagram_scope`. Single file or stated scope → skip.

Run Pass 1 only (deterministic manifest, no LLM): `workflows/extract.md` Steps 0-2. Store the result as `manifest_cache` and pass it to the chosen lane so Pass 1 never re-runs. Matter-description-only input (no docs) has no Pass 1 counts; proceed without them.

### Step 2 — GATE A: build mode (after ingestion) ⛔ BLOCKING

**Explicit flag answers the gate.** The user typing `--direct` or `--guided` is the recorded gate answer, carried in advance; skip the gate prompt, state the resolved mode in one line ("Build mode: direct (flag)"), and load the lane. This is an answer-carrier, not a bypass.

**No flag → present the structured choice.** Lead with what Pass 1 found, in plain language: "Found [N parties, M events, ...]. How should I build it?" (omit counts for no-docs input). Options:

- **Guided, step by step**
- **Direct, just make it**

Smart preselect from phrasing only, list the implied option first: "just make it", "quick", or a named diagram type → Direct first; "step by step", "build it with me", or no fast signal → Guided first. Phrasing is inference, never an answer; without an explicit flag the gate always shows and the user confirms or switches.

On choice: load `workflows/direct.md` or `workflows/guided.md`, passing `manifest_cache`, `input_source`, and `diagram_scope`. Both lanes share `workflows/generation.md` for the build; GATE B (HTML report) fires there.

**User-facing language (casual-friendly).** Never show Mermaid-internal type names to user. Use the plain-language names in `shared/diagram-type-map.md` § Plain-language names — "timeline", "org chart", "flowchart", "obligation checklist", and so on. Accept plain-word requests too ("make me an org chart") and map them through the same glossary. Legal vocabulary is fine; technical diagram vocabulary stays internal.

**Output language (EN/FR).** Gates, digest, elicitation, and rationale render in the user's prompt language (EN or FR; FR diagram names per the glossary's FR column). Extracted evidence and diagram labels stay verbatim source language, never translated. HTML export chrome follows via `render_html.py --ui-lang en|fr`.

## Scripts

All script commands run from the skill root (the folder containing this `SKILL.md`). Resolve the skill root once, then invoke scripts as `python scripts/<name>.py`.

| Script                        | Role                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/check_setup.py`      | Dependency check → `{ok, missing[], installed[], optional{}}`                           |
| `scripts/first_run.py`        | First-run state → `{state}` (`returning`/`first_run`/`unknown`); `--mark` consumes flag |
| `scripts/extract_entities.py` | Orchestrator: normalize → detect → manifest JSON                                        |
| `scripts/diagram_selector.py` | Enriched extraction + intent → recommended type                                         |
| `scripts/render_html.py`      | Mermaid + FigureDescription → standalone HTML                                           |

`scripts/normalize/` (format adapters) and `scripts/extraction/` (candidate harvesters, resolver, and materializer) are libraries used by the orchestrator. Install deps once: `pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt` for release-verified versions, or omit `-c constraints.txt` for broad compatibility testing.

## Output

Output is chat or terminal display only: the fenced Mermaid block renders in a Mermaid-capable chat or Markdown viewer, and as syntax-highlighted code in a terminal. No note is written to disk. After the block, GATE B offers an HTML report as a structured choice; the export escapes matter text, runs Mermaid in strict mode, uses vendored Mermaid when present, and loads the pinned CDN fallback only when explicitly enabled. Full output rules: `workflows/generation.md` § Step 5.

## Boundaries

Mermaid is for thinking, planning, explaining, and generating structure. It is not legal advice, not a court-ready exhibit, and not a substitute for legal writing. Every diagram carries a caveat line. Confidential material stays in tools approved for that matter.
